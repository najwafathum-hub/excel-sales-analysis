# Sales Analysis Using Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Microsoft Excel** to perform sales data analysis, focusing on data cleaning, formula-based calculations, and summary insights using **Pivot Tables**.  

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains fictional sales transaction data with the following attributes:
- Order ID  
- Order Date  
- Product Category  
- Product Name  
- Region  
- Quantity  
- Unit Price  
- Total Sales  

The dataset is structured to simulate real-world retail sales data.

## Tools & Skills Used

- Data Cleaning & Organization
- Excel Formulas:
  - `SUM`
  - `AVERAGE`
  - `MAX`
  - `MIN`
  - `COUNT`
  - `SUMIF`
- **Pivot Tables** for data summarization
- Basic Sales Performance Analysis

## Analysis Performed
1. **Total Sales Calculation**
